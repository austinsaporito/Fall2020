*all programs are in python and you should just have to run it with python3 "filename.py" 

1.) downloaded in the directory

2.) run it as python3 globalign.py in the same directory as the files

3.) run it like above, and there is alot less "-" in the string but some it is also just the alignment from where the score was the highest

4.) run it like above it is named egfalign.py

5.) our two strings are different but I can only make the assumption that we had different mismatch and match and gap scores
	considering that also out score is vastly different.

	length: 1269

	e-value: 4e-65

	score: 

	identity: 293/399(73%)

6.) Culicidae with 104 hits

	organsism: Anopheles gambiae str. PEST	
	Blast name: mosquitos
	score: 3644	
	number of hits: 6

7.) run in the same dir as the files and is named egflinear.py and its score was the same 620
