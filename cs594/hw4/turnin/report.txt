Bio-informatics

5) have delta file

6) have the snps file and a png of the graph.

7) the two genomes were closely aligned from looking at the results and nucmer. if I was reading 
the results correctly there were not many snps. I also have a png file of the two strains graphed. 
Because the two straines are related I figured they would be pretty closely related because they are 
related. so I can assume the difference is from the ancestor genome and the Ames has evolved to possibly be better.
Because they are very closely related I would assume the structure is nearly the same between the two. Looking 
at the graph the split between the line the dot plot looks the same.

8) contigs included

9) contigs included

10) delta file included

11) Between these two genomes I do not think they line up very well. I can see night and day difference between the two 
png graphs. the first one is very clean and readable while this one looks like a jumbled mess. also because there were many 
contigs they are not good assemblies further confirming my assumption. I assumed Dr. Emirch just made a kitchen sink of genomes
and because of this it doesnt align well with the influenza genome.
